Scraping-with-scrapy-in-python
==============================

A baby problem in scraping in python 

For an overview on scrapy - see the official documentation at -  http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html

I have tried to keep the "baby_scaping.py" as basic/bare-bones as possible(I have not even used the lxml) - will add more files to this repo on pagination & intelligent crawling
All you need to understand this is 3 broad things -:
1. What a scraper really does and the overview of offcial Tutorial 
2. Building Xpaths and trying it out with XPath checker plugin in modzilla
3. Writing your spider to extract the items of interest from the webpage.
