# A baby problem in scraping in python  - will keep this file seperate and add more files in the repository

scrapy startproject ebay

# To call the crawler, go to the top most directory structure and..
# Note that "ebay" is the name of the spider in Myspider class and this is the one that is used to refer to the spider 
scrapy crawl ebay
# This begins crawling, prints the output to the screen (of course, because you asked for it!) and also genates the csv file, that you can see
